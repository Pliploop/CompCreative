# 🎼 CompCreative – Controllable Music Generation

This repository contains the code and experimental notebook for **Controllable Music Generation via Latent Diffusion and DDIM Inversion**, a project for the ECS7022P Computational Creativity module.

The system allows:
- 🎨 **Prompt-based music generation** using text captions
- 🔁 **Post-hoc editing** via DDIM inversion and audio-to-audio guidance
- 🎛 **Direct latent manipulation** through vector-style and image-style transformations

It is designed for **co-creative workflows**, particularly useful in sample-based production and live performance contexts.
